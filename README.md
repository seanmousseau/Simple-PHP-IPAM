# Simple-PHP-IPAM

A lightweight **IP Address Management (IPAM)** web application built with PHP 8.2+ and SQLite. Designed for small to mid-sized environments that need straightforward subnet and address tracking without the complexity of a full enterprise IPAM platform.

No Composer, no npm, no external dependencies — just PHP and a web server.

## What's new in v2.9.1

Hotfix release for one post-v2.9.0 user report. No new features, no schema changes, no behavioural differences — upgrade is safe from any v2.9.x install.

- **Graceful 413 on oversized SQL imports.** Uploading a SQL dump larger than `post_max_size` previously produced a wall of "headers already sent" warnings and left the session broken, with no indication of what actually went wrong. Root cause: PHP emitted its size-limit warning to stdout *before any script ran*, committing the HTTP response body and cascading into every `session_start()` call in `init.php`. Fixed by (a) raising the bundled `.htaccess` defaults to `upload_max_filesize 512M` / `post_max_size 520M`, (b) suppressing PHP startup warnings from HTTP output via `php_flag display_startup_errors Off` (they still land in the error log), and (c) a narrow early `CONTENT_LENGTH` check in `db_tools.php` that emits a clean 413 page with per-SAPI guidance *before* `init.php` runs.
- **New docs section: "Upload limits for DB import"** in `docs/install.md` — the table of places to raise limits per server type (Apache + mod_php, PHP-FPM, CGI, nginx / Caddy) and the app-level `import_sql_max_mb` soft cap in `config.php` (default 200 MB).

**All v2.9.0 features from the driver-abstraction foundation release are still present** — Dialect abstraction, BLOB affinity normalization, Composer runtime-dep infrastructure, CI tier restructure, containerized `test_api.sh`, `oidc.default_role` dropdown. See the [v2.9.0 CHANGELOG entry](CHANGELOG.md#290---2026-04-15) for the full list.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release history, [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md) for upgrade notes, and [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the settings transition plan.

## Features

### Core IPAM
- Manage **IPv4 and IPv6 subnets** (CIDR notation) with validation and normalization
- Manage **address records** with hostname, owner, status (`used` / `reserved` / `free`), and notes
- Subnet **hierarchy view** — parent/child nesting with expand/collapse for both IPv4 and IPv6
- **Subnet overlap detection** — warns when a new subnet nests inside or contains existing ones
- **Unassigned IP tracking** — lists assignable IPs (IPv4 and IPv6, capped at 256) with no address record and a quick-add form
- Correct IP sorting using packed binary storage (`ip_bin`, `network_bin`)
- **Auto-reserve** network/broadcast/gateway IPs on subnet create (configurable)

### Search & Productivity
- **Dashboard** — utilization bars for top subnets, per-site address breakdown, recent audit activity
- **Global search** across IP / hostname / owner / note with filters for status, site, IP version, and tag
- **Bulk update** — update hostname / owner / status / note / MAC / expiry across multiple addresses at once, with bulk delete
- **CSV import wizard** (admin-only) — upload, map columns, dry-run preview, then apply; supports auto-create missing subnets
- **CSV exports** — addresses per subnet, all addresses cross-subnet, subnet utilization summary, address change history, search results, unassigned IPs, audit log

### Organisation
- **Sites** — group subnets by location or network segment; supports **site hierarchy** (region → site)
- **VLANs** — first-class VLAN objects linked to subnets; admin CRUD at `/vlans.php`
- **Tags** — colour-coded labels attachable to subnets and addresses; filter by tag in search and API
- Child subnets automatically **inherit the site** of their enclosing parent

### Security & Access Control
- HTTPS enforced at the application layer; secure session cookies (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`)
- **Login rate limiting** — IP-based lockout after repeated failed attempts
- **Session idle timeout** — automatic logout after configurable inactivity period
- CSRF protection on all POST requests; PDO prepared statements throughout
- **RBAC roles:** `admin` (full access), `readonly`
- Append-only audit log enforced with SQLite triggers
- **OIDC SSO** — Authorization Code + PKCE in pure PHP; auto-provision and auto-link; optional `disable_local_login`
- **User management** — name/email fields, per-user enable/disable, delete, manual SSO linking

### Administration
- **Database Tools** — one-click SQL export, SQL import with pre-import backup, manual backup trigger, backup status panel
- **Automatic backups** — configurable daily/weekly SQLite snapshots with retention pruning
- **Config auto-population** — missing config keys appended with defaults on boot; admin notice on first load
- **Responsive GUI** — sticky headers, slide-in form drawer, mobile hamburger nav, sortable columns, breadcrumbs
- **Email utilization alerts** — configurable warn/critical thresholds with 24-hour per-subnet cooldown
- **Health check endpoint** — unauthenticated `GET /status.php` returns JSON status and version for uptime monitors and container health checks
- **Audit log retention** — configurable pruning of old audit entries during scheduled housekeeping

### REST API
- JSON REST API (`api.php`) authenticated with API keys
- **Read-only API keys** — admin-toggleable flag restricts a key to GET-only access; write attempts return 403
- **API key descriptions** — optional free-text field to document what each key is for
- Read: subnets (with `vlan_name`, `tags[]`), addresses (with `tags[]`), sites (with `parent_id`), VLANs, address history, search, audit log, unassigned IPs
- Filters: `?tag=`, `?vlan_id=`, `?parent_id=`, `?expired=1`, `?site_id=`, `?ip_version=`
- Write: create / update / delete subnets, addresses, sites, and VLANs (POST / PUT / DELETE)
- **Bulk write** — `POST ?resource=addresses&bulk=1` / `POST ?resource=subnets&bulk=1` with JSON array; partial success returns HTTP 207
